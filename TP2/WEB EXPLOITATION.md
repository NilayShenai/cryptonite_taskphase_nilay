## 7. **Who are you?**
- **Challenge**: Modify HTTP headers to access the flag.
- **Solution**:
  1. Modified the HTTP request headers:
     - `User-Agent: PicoBrowser`
     - `Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:52362`
     - `Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT`
     - `DNT: 1`
     - `X-Forwarded-For: 92.44.242.19` (Swedish IP)
     - `Accept-Language: sv-sv,sv;q=0.9`
  2. Sent the following GET request:
     ```http
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
     Accept-Language: sv-sv,sv;q=0.9
     Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT
     DNT: 1
     User-Agent: PicoBrowser
     Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:52362
     X-Forwarded-For: 92.44.242.19
     ```
  3. Retrieved the flag with the modified request.

## 8. **Power cookies**
- **Challenge**: Escalate privileges via cookies.
- **Solution**:
  1. Intercepted a request.
  2. Changed `isAdmin=0` to `isAdmin=1` in the cookie.
  3. Gained admin access and retrieved the flag.

---

## 9. **Most Cookies**
- **Challenge**: Generate a valid Flask session cookie with admin privileges.
- **Tools Used**: `flask-unsign`.
- **Solution**:
  ```python
  payload = '{"very_auth": "admin"}'
  ```
  - Created a signed cookie with admin privileges and used it to retrieve the flag.

---

## 10. **MORE SQLI**
- **Challenge**: Bypass login using SQL injection.
- **Solution**:
  - Entered the following payload as the password:
    ```sql
    '-or 1=1;--
    ```
  - Exposed the flag in the response headers.

---

## 11. **SOAP**
- **Challenge**: Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) to access sensitive files.
- **Solution**:
  - Tried XXE payloads to read `/etc/passwd`, but access was blocked by the parser.
  - Blind XXE and parameter injection attempts also restricted due to high security settings.
  - Tried NOSQL INJECTIONS($ne,$eq), It worked.

---

### Notes
- Various tools were used throughout these challenges, such as:
  - **Burp Suite** for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests.
  - **psql** for PostgreSQL database access.
  - **flask-unsign** for generating and modifying Flask cookies.
